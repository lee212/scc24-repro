Instructions for the Reproducibility Challenge
================================================================================

The Reproducibility Challenge is based on the SC23 paper [Data Flow Lifecycles for Optimizing Workflow Coordination](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3581784.3607104).

The goal of the challenge is to reproduce results from this paper. The challenge will be evaluated based on a written report, limited to 6 pages, that should be handed to the SCC committee at the end of the competition. Here are the requirements for this report:

- Provide a description of your hardware.

- Provide a description of the software stack used to perform the experiments.

- Reproduce Figure x, y, z
